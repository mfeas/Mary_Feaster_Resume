Hello there!

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mary Feaster, and I'm on an exciting journey from the fast-paced world of auto service advising to the dynamic realm of data analysis.

### About Me:

In my previous role as an auto service advisor, I developed a keen sense of customer needs and built strong relationships, skills I believe are transferable to the world of data analysis. My curiosity and passion for technology recently led me to complete the Data Analyst Boot Camp at the University of North Carolina Charlotte, where I honed my analytical skills and learned the ins and outs of Python, SQL, and Excel.

### Why Data Analysis?

You might be wondering why I'm making this leap into data analysis. Well, while my roots are in sales and customer service, the power of data to tell stories and guide strategic decisions has always fascinated me. The UNCC Data Analyst Boot Camp was the perfect launchpad to formalize my skills and embark on this new adventure.

### What I Bring to the Table:

- **Analytical Skills:** Trained in the latest data analysis techniques, I thrive in extracting insights from complex datasets.

- **Communication:** My background in sales has equipped me with the ability to convey technical findings in a way that resonates with diverse stakeholders.

### What I'm Seeking:

I am eager to contribute my unique blend of skills and experiences to a team that values creativity and analytical thinking. I am particularly drawn to environments that appreciate the artistry in data analysis and encourage innovative problem-solving. If you represent a team that embraces challenges, values continuous learning, and is passionate about making data-driven decisions, I am excited about the possibility of joining your ranks and making meaningful contributions.

### Let's Connect:

I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my newfound skills in a challenging and collaborative environment. My resume is within this repository in both a viewable PDF and as a downloadable word file for your consideration. I would love to connect further to discuss how my background and skills align with the needs of your team.

Looking forward to the possibilities ahead!

Best,

Mary Feaster
